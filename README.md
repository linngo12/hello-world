# hello-world
Introductory projects, files, etc. to get the hang of github.

My name is Lindsey Ngo and this is my first ReadMe file. I've never written one of these before, but i'm so excited to get started on this journey. I enjoy ice cream and petting my dog who's more like a cat + hamster had a baby the size of a shih tzu.
